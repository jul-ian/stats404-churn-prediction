Predicting Customer Churn

Statement of Problem:
The business problem to be analyzed is the customer churn of a telecom company. The "churn" of customers is the
number or percentage of customers that cease using the service in a given time frame. 

Client:
The telecommunications company Cell2Cell

Key Business Question:
The key question we would like to answer is if we can foresee and potentially prevent a customer from cancelling 
their cell phone service. We would attempt to ascertain the propensity of a customer cancelling based on details 
collected by the company.

Data Sources:

Business Impact of Work:
We want to minimize the churn rate since this has a large impact on revenue. According to the dataset, 
14,711 customers churned over the month the data covers, costing the company about $849,105.00 in monthly revenue. 
Even if a small percentage (say 20%) of this is prevented, it is still a sizable increase in monthly revenue.

How business will use model:
The model will be used by the company to predict what customers have a high probability of churning. Then it will 
implement strategies to keep them from cancelling their service. These can include offers of special 
promotions or increased marketing.

Metric:
F-score will be used to ascertain if the model is a good fit.
